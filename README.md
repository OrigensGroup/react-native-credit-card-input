# react-native-library-tsdx

A template for building libraries with React Native using `tsdx`. Includes a bunch of config that's a pain to setup when running a local build that uses your library. 

## Example

```tsx
//  in /example/src/App.tsx:

import { MyLib } from 'my-library';

function MyApp() {
  return <MyLib />;
}
```
